I. Introduction (5 minutes)
Briefly explain the purpose of version control systems.
Introduce Git and GitHub: their significance in collaborative software development.
II. Understanding Git (10 minutes)

What is Git?
Definition: Distributed version control system.
Benefits: Collaboration, tracking changes, branching, etc.

Key Concepts
Repository: Local vs. Remote
Commit: Snapshot of changes
Branching: Parallel lines of development
Merge: Combining changes

Basic Workflow
Initializing a repository (git init)

Tracking changes (git add, git commit)

Checking status (git status)

Viewing commit history (git log)

III. Essential Commands (10 minutes)

Creating and Cloning Repositories

git init: Initialize a local repository.

git clone: Clone a repository from GitHub.

IV. GitHub (5 minutes)

What is GitHub?

Explanation: Hosting platform for Git repositories.

Features: Collaboration, issue tracking, pull requests, etc.

Creating a GitHub Repository

Creating a new repository on GitHub.

V. Best Practices and Conclusion (5 minutes)

Commit messages: Descriptive and meaningful.

Pull requests: Collaborative code review.

Importance of regular commits and updates.

VI. Q&A (5 minutes)

Encourage students to ask questions and clarify doubts.
